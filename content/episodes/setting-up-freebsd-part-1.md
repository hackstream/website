## Introduction

In this episode, we will learn how to setup a FreeBSD 12.1 server in DigitalOcean. We want to play around with FreeBSD stack because we want to get out of our "Linux" comfort zone.

We used Terraform to [create](https://github.com/hackstream/freebsd-droplet) a FreeBSD droplet. We are going to run a public facing DNSCrypt server upstreaming to Unbound. We will explore how to configure and run applications with FreeBSD Jail and set all of it from scratch using iocage.
