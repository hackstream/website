Hackstream is a fun experiment where [Karan](https://mrkaran.dev/) and [Sarat](https://www.saratchandra.in/) hack on interesting projects and record our learnings/process.
We like to tackle difficult and fun problems. Anything that puts us out of comfort zone is something that we like to tinker upon.

Find out more about our projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/hackstream).
